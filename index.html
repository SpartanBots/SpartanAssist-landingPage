	<h1>Welcome to SpartanBot Page</h1>

	<p>Have you used todoList apps before? </p>

	<p>The slack app directories already have a lot todo list apps.  SpartanBot is a special creation based on end users practice(s).  It's definitely a problem worth sloving.
	</p>

	<!-- This thought still in mind as I wrote this paragraph:

	My thoughts were that the separate companies deliberately did that to "make money" in that sense of customer not being satisfied with one app and turned to another and started comparing and using the different apps to see which one is/was better  -->
	<p>Was there an app that had one function that the other had and vice versa.  The apps were incomplete (in that sense).  SpartanBot helps as it is an additional creation to the overall puzzle piece for what we call life and how we can function with tools at hand.  </p>

	<h1>We built a bot that mimics a normal physical meeting sturcture</h1>
	<h3>automatic note taking functions</h3>
	<p>So usually, in a meeting, people take turns to speak and share ideas and follow a process/structure or procedure. On a text based medium like we are doing, everyone is just kind of typing whenever they have anything to say meanwhile it is likely that other ideas have not even been digested yet.</p>
	<p>eg. you if you have anything to say you press a button or raise your hand and everyone gives you a chance to get your point across or something along those lines</p>
	<p>say if you want a certain message to be recorded, you reply that message with a reaction like this :heavy_check_mark:  , then SpartanBot will automatically add it to a note.</p>

	<p>we all pay attention to one person to get their point across it would be more productive vs running the entire meeting like a brainstorming session even though it could be a part of subsection of it </p>
	<p>like specific roles, leaders, facilitators, and other techniques that help optimize meetings and stuff</p>


	<button>Add to Slack</button>

<!--
This section is from the app page where the bot was created.  I put it all in a section for now...

looking to make it similar to the api website that has the app:
https://api.slack.com/apps/A4Q27TTRA/
-->



<!--
This may go on either side left or right, maybe equivalent to side by side with above section

how to use the bot 

the idea should focus on what type of problem you intend to solve. 

as each program should have a purpose and ideally solve a reality problem / a problem to solve



interactivity and functionality sides

	<h3>Featured use of SpartanBot (Bot Ideas)</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>1. message scheduler</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Productivity</li> 
				<ul>
					<li>Think about the things you want to do within slack.  Does slack have that function yet?</li>
					<li>Manage your message history or bookmarking / note taking </li>
				</ul>

				<li>Scheduling</li>
					<ul>
					<li>Scheduling messages</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Save for later</li>
							- making it easier to catch up on past conversation

							<li>Set up basic steps and criteria</li>
							- creating an easier way to run meetings on slack
						</ul>
					</ul>
			</ul>

		<li>2. quora integration </li>
		
		<li>3. Have SpartanBot set a user statement as a "read it later"</li>
		
		<li>4. Create w/ SpartanBot a project deadline countdown</li>
		
		<li>5. Vybe with SpartanBot with your favorite music within spotify(or other music api) integration</li>
	</ul>
	
	<!-- Other ideas
	only enable one person texting at a time in slack 
	- so everyone can actually pay attention to that person and bookmark specific topics or aspects of the messages to be in the note? 
	- somewhere in the slack api page there's a delay function on sending message.
	

	I would love to combine them together. or we can start with something and keep those other features in mind and add them later
