Additional Statements from prior Meetings:






franc [1:35 PM] 
cool. shall we start with the bot idea?

kingzlo [1:35 PM] 
Let's do that

[1:36]  
Any idea as of yet for the bot itself (design wise) or not as of yet?

[1:36]  
Mind you all, the meeting should be based upon what was discussed prior with add ons in that sense.  Agreed?










sdq [1:37 PM] 
to be clear, the main goal for the meeting is ideas, stack, and structure or process?

kingzlo [1:37 PM] 
I set a timer for 1 hour for last time was much longer than that and future reference may just be shorter

franc [1:37 PM] 
I have a list of ideas lol
not sure any of those have already been made or not though













franc [1:39 PM] 
1. message scheduler - schedule when you want to send a message to someone

sdq [1:39 PM] 
yep

kingzlo [1:39 PM] 
Cool

[1:39]  
??? Message scheduler?

[1:39]  
@franc

franc [1:39 PM] 
2. project deadline countdown - automatic reminder; create a list of projects and deadlines. (edited)

kingzlo [1:40 PM] 
Ah your ideas, ok

sdq [1:40 PM] 
inspiration or motivator for any of the ideas

kingzlo [1:41 PM] 
@franc, are these addons for the terllo?

franc [1:41 PM] 
yes. I'm typing my ideas. please share yours too. then we can disscuss

sdq [1:41 PM] 
Like send 1 or 2 quotes related to the item on the schedule?

kingzlo [1:41 PM] 
ok

[1:43]  
My thoughts is back to creation of the page and how we should create individual versions and collaborate or what to take in or leave out (as I look over the the trello: splash Page






franc [1:43 PM] 
@sdq it's like a bot controlling when you want to send a message. so after you set a time. it will automatically send it for you.

Learn how to build bot users, send notifications, and interact with team members using our APIs.










franc [1:55 PM] 
this is the page describing all the things the slack api can do

[1:56]  
from my understanding, an app can create a bot account, send messages as a bot, get information from the user/channel/team, create a / command, etc.






franc [1:48 PM] 
https://api.slack.com/slack-apps




franc [1:58 PM] 
take a look at this example https://fireflies.ai/guide








franc [2:02 PM] 
But i don't think they schedule messages

sdq [2:03 PM] 
Then lets do it, although I just thought of 2 ideas

kingzlo [2:03 PM] 
what are your ideas @sdq

franc [2:03 PM] 
what's your idea?

kingzlo [2:04 PM] 
:slightly_smiling_face:

[2:04]  
and we can compare/contrast for I'm thinking to break down @franc's idea from #1

[2:04]  
go on @sdq...

sdq [2:05 PM] 
one is making it easier to catch up on past conversation? and creating an easier way to run meetings on slack by setting up basic steps and criteria

franc [2:07 PM] 
@sdq i like this idea too. I was also thinking of something to better manage the message history or bookmarking / note taking sort of thing

kingzlo [2:07 PM] 
right I'm seeing that

franc [2:08 PM] 
although slack already has star and reminder function, it doesn't really has a section to browse the message history

kingzlo [2:08 PM] 
so it's an arrangement or plan of an event (as I looked up schedule in dictionary, LOL)

[2:08]  
?

sdq [2:08 PM] 
@kingzlo are you asking as per the idea for running meetings better?

kingzlo [2:09 PM] 
@sdq, just trying to get a better understanding of the "Scheduler"

franc [2:10 PM] 
@kingzlo you talking about my idea, the message scheduler?

kingzlo [2:10 PM] 
Yes @franc.  And @sdq spoke of similarity to that based upon his idea.  Yes/no @sdq?

sdq [2:11 PM] 
yes i see the similarity

kingzlo [2:11 PM] 
At the same time, as I look over your idea(s), those are separate idea(s)?

franc [2:11 PM] 
hmm maybe we can combine the ideas together

kingzlo [2:11 PM] 
@franc

franc [2:12 PM] 
@kingzlo i think it's different. but they are all productivity tools

sdq [2:12 PM] 
ok let me quickly paint a picture of what i am thinkin

franc [2:12 PM] 
so maybe we can make an app has both funtionalities

kingzlo [2:13 PM] 
Sounds interesting.  But maybe to break down for better understanding.














kingzlo [2:13 PM] 
For as I'm thinking of an idea in the past, and mentioned here before is to create a todoList (for I'm familiar with that.

[2:14]  
Question on that, here me out

[2:14]  
Have you used todoList apps before?

franc [2:15 PM] 
@kingzlo the slack app directories already have a lot todo list apps lol although I would love to create one for practice

kingzlo [2:15 PM] 
Was there an app that had one function that the other had and vice versa.  The apps were incomplete in that sense.  My thoughts were that the separate companies deliberately did that to "make money" in that sense of customer not being satisfied with one app and turned to another and started comparing and using the different apps to see which one is/was better













sdq [2:16 PM] 
So usually, in a meeting, people take turns to speak and share ideas and follow a process/structure or procedure. On a text based medium like we are doing, everyone is just kind of typing whenever they have anything to say meanwhile it is likely that other ideas have not even been digested yet. so how about we build a bot that mimics a normal physical meeting sturcture. eg. you if you have anything to say you press a burton or raise your hand and everyone gives you a chance to get your point across or something along those lines?

kingzlo [2:17 PM] 
Sounds interesting @sdq

sdq [2:17 PM] 
it may be very simple but I am thinking of how we are currently running this meeting and am thinking this can be done better

kingzlo [2:17 PM] 
@franc,  your thoughts

franc [2:17 PM] 
@sdq true. it's definitely a problem worth sloving

[2:18]  
i am thinking maybe using some kind of automatic note taking functions to solve that problem

[2:20]  
say if you want a certain message to be recorded, you reply that message with a reaction like this :heavy_check_mark: , then the bot will automatically add it to a note

[2:20]  
so at the end of the meeting, we will have a note digest created already

[2:20]  
from the meeting

kingzlo [2:20 PM] 
Sounds interesting @franc and @sdq











sdq [2:20 PM] 
we can incorporate other stuff like specific roles, leaders, facilitators, and other techniques that help optimize meetings and stuff. @franc yes that could be good. my idea stems from the fact that I feel like if we all pay attention to one person to get their point across it would be more productive vs running the entire meeting like a brainstorming session even though it could be a part of subsection of it

[2:21]  
@franc sound like a great idea

franc [2:21 PM] 
so it's like a meeting assistant bot :slightly_smiling_face:

sdq [2:22 PM] 
i like that @franc

[2:23]  
is there a way to only enable one person texting at a time in slack?

franc [2:23 PM] 
@sdq why would you want to do that?

sdq [2:24 PM] 
so everyone can actually pay attention to that person and bookmark specific topics or aspects of the messages to be in the note?













franc [2:25 PM] 
@sdq i remember i saw somewhere in the slack api page there's a delay function on sending message. I can look into it later.






sdq [2:26 PM] 
I feel like so far, we just coast through our ideas and not having the time to actually digest and go over stuff and ask questions because we are all thinking of what we are going to contribute ourselves and as a result, possibly miss out on relevant info










franc [2:29 PM] 
so basically we have two concrete ideas so far?  the message scheduler and the meeting assistant ?








franc [2:32 PM] 
I would love to combine them together. or we can start with something and keep those other features in mind and add them later

[2:32]  
@kingzlo i think we are going to make the bot ourselves lol

[2:33]  
I would love to do the backend. maybe we can set roles based on that? @kingzlo would you like to focus on the front-end?







sdq [2:33 PM] 
I think we are building the bot our selves. and I think we should start with the scheduler f or now. we can always improve or build on our bot











franc [2:34 PM] 
@sdq sounds good. we can make a list of potential features and start from there









https://trello.com/b/ySs7H6hL/planner



franc [2:38 PM] 
we are all here learning though. so by building this project, i wish i can learn things that can be added to my skill set.

kingzlo [2:38 PM] 
1 hour just passed.  but there is progress in this second meeting of what has been broken down for what we are to create for the Bot.

sdq [2:38 PM] 
Thanks and I am looking to really do this aggresively. Anyway can we decide on the idea? I chose to start with the message scheduler

franc [2:39 PM] 
+ 1 for the message scheduler. (edited)

kingzlo [2:39 PM] 
@franc what do you think, the message scheduler (being your....

[2:39]  
I agree as well then

sdq [2:40 PM] 
and i am open to doing both although I would suggest we take it slow for now since we decideed not to reengineer and do our own stuff

franc [2:40 PM] 
@kingzlo I would like to add the meeting assistant to the feature list as well

kingzlo [2:40 PM] 
Keep that in mind then @franc

franc [2:40 PM] 
let's name it something more general so we can add other functions later if we want to







kingzlo [2:41 PM] 
"2 Part Bot idea"

[2:42]  
theSchedulerAssistantBot (I just love camelCase)

sdq [2:42 PM] 
sweet! I can picture slack being even more valuable by being able to actually hold group meetings better! The next CHINGU COHORTS will benefit a lot from out

[2:42]  
Our bot

kingzlo [2:42 PM] 
Right @sdq

franc [2:43 PM] 
haha could just be "assistant" and the scheduler is just one of the features











franc [2:50 PM] 
so on this page https://api.slack.com/slack-apps
if you click "create a slack app", it will ask you which development team are you in. all the team members will have access to the app and become collaborators automatically. So I think it may not a good idea creating the app under Chingu-Koalas. We need a separate team for developing the app.
api.slack.com
Building Slack apps
Learn how to build bot users, send notifications, and interact with team members using our APIs.
 

kingzlo [2:51 PM] 
Right for our role within Koalas is to work on the "Splash Page" version of it.  Makes sense.

franc [2:52 PM] 
besides that, we can also test the functionalities within the dev team.

sdq [2:52 PM] 
ok wouldn't we need to build it on Github first?

kingzlo [2:52 PM] 
We can all learn from each other on going from Front-End to Back-End :slightly_smiling_face:












franc [3:00 PM] 
@kingzlo I was talking about the necessity of another team and creating app on slack api page






kingzlo [3:01 PM] 
Right @franc.  But our focus based upon what was stated earlier in the meeting.  The app slack api page should be an addon to the trello in that sense

[3:01]  
and a focus within another meeting, I think

[3:02]  
maybe even next meeting







sdq [3:02 PM] 
I don't think we need another team though. I read Chances article about bots created by a group of three in two months from previous cohort so i think we are the team but we surely need to seek help from other teams






franc [3:05 PM] 
so here's what it is said on slack api page
>>>Creating apps

Your app can do a little. Your app can do a lot. It can be a simple tool, it can even be a bot.

Start by creating a Slack app for your team. Slack apps begin life locked down just for your team.

If you don't have a Slack team or just want your own personal sandbox to develop in, create a new team and return when ready. Just be sure to carefully decide where your Slack app will live. The app record cannot be moved to another team later.

Whether a Slack app first-time integrator or a seasoned veteran, it's often best to just get started and learn what's what along the way.







sdq [3:05 PM] 
No this is my first cohort, I just read about it from Chances medium page. naming? the options are SpartanAssistant, SpartanAssist, ShcedularAssistantBot, SmartAssist, SpartAssist




sdq [3:11 PM] 
our tagline or short description can be: SpartanAssist,  a message scheduler and meeting assistant bot?





franc [3:53 PM] 
So once you accept the invitation and join the dev team, login on the slack api page here with the dev team: *SpartanBots*
https://api.slack.com/apps
Then you will be able to see the app i created. By looking at the actual app may help you think about the features and functionalities.








20170330

franc [6:08 PM] 
the most important thing on the agenda I think is the app features.

kingzlo [6:09 PM] 
right.  The details of it, in that sense.

[6:09]  
This would help with thinking where to go on the front end as well with deeper thought of the functionality

sdq [6:09 PM] 
Yea I looked at the slack you created Frank and i think we need most of the features

franc [6:09 PM] 
once we decide the features/functionalities of the app. we can start laying out the information structure and the design










sdq [6:10 PM] 
What do you think in terms of funtionality? How would it work?

[6:11]  
Keep in mind we are think of scheduling messages and helping with making meetings run better

franc [6:11 PM] 
@sdq yes, from the api side, we would need a bot user account, slash command, incoming webhook, etc









sdq [6:10 PM] 
What do you think in terms of funtionality? How would it work?

[6:11]  
Keep in mind we are think of scheduling messages and helping with making meetings run better

franc [6:11 PM] 
@sdq yes, from the api side, we would need a bot user account, slash command, incoming webhook, etc





kingzlo [6:11 PM
that is the question in a sense of breaking it down into pseudocode.  Example of what I'm thinking with Simon Game right now:

*************************************
pseudocode for Simon App
*************************************








kingzlo [6:13 PM] 
So it's the API in that sense of Homework to get into for creation of the bot?






franc [6:14 PM] 
the basic functionalities for our app I think should include:
1. send messages for the user at a scheduled time  (message scheduler)
2. add messages to a note  (meeting assistant)

[6:15]  
That is the main purpose of our app, right?

kingzlo [6:15 PM] 
So we are to think about breaking it down into PseudoCode or even just english to then convert to code and see the design perspective of it.

[6:16]  
Then this should be the homework for next meeting.

sdq [6:16 PM] 
I was thinking adding features like calling specific commands like /spartan meeting leader, time, facilitator, notes, etc

[6:16]  
Within text messages

[6:16]  
Or am I completely off?

kingzlo [6:16 PM] 
@sdq, sounds like we have some keywords (edited)

franc [6:17 PM] 
@kingzlo I think we should first define the features, then break it down to tasks we need to perform to build the features, then assign the tasks to each person

kingzlo [6:18 PM] 
Right, lets define the features then






sdq [6:20 PM] 
I think we need to determine how the message scheduling would work and then brainstorm all the key tasks or features in trello and discuss how that would work




franc [6:24 PM] 
So the message scheduling is like this:
Imagine you are working late and just finished something at 1am. But you don't want to bother others by sending something this late. Ideally you would like to send things early next morning. But you are afraid you couldn't get up that early next morning. So here comes in the message scheduler. You draft the message then use the bot to set a time you want the message to be sent out. Then you go to bed. next morning the bot will automatically send the message at the scheduled time for you.

[6:25]  
I'm just creating a user scenario so you have a better idea how it works

kingzlo [6:26 PM] 
feature - It has a timer of when alarm goes off

[6:26]  
Set to message scheduler

franc [6:27 PM] 
you don't really need an alarm. you just set a time you want the message to be sent. the bot will send the message out at that time for you.









franc [6:27 PM] 
so for example, you type a slash command first, like "/schedule message"

[6:28]  
then the bot will ask you to draft a message

kingzlo [6:28 PM] 
right

franc [6:28 PM] 
once you finish the message, the bot will ask what time you want it to be sent

[6:28]  
then you set the time

[6:28]  
then you can go to bed lol

[6:28]  
the bot will handle the rest

kingzlo [6:28 PM] 
I'm seeing it more now

franc [6:29 PM] 
oh wait, you also need to tell the bot who you are going to send the message to

kingzlo [6:30 PM] 
I'm thinking that may have came into thought as I sit and think deeper into this now :slightly_smiling_face:

[6:31]  
It seems like the homework that may be able to break down for roles soon as well




franc [6:32 PM] 
so that's the message scheduler :slightly_smiling_face:
as for the meeting assistant. There are too many possible features for that. I think we better just build one feature first. If that goes well, we can add more later. So one feature I can think of is to automatically add a message you think is important to a note.






sdq [6:34 PM] 
I think we can just start as @franc suggested and once we can build one feature it should work for every other feature for meetings assistant

franc [6:34 PM] 
@kingzlo right. in order to define roles, we need a list of tasks first. so that everyone would be clear what to do.






sdq [6:34 PM] 
I think we should list tasks item in trello with notes on what we are thinking about the functionality

kingzlo [6:35 PM] 
their is the front end and back end in this and we may be able to break it down piece by piece together in that sense of brainstorming as we did/doing








franc [6:35 PM] 
sure. maybe you can just type your thoughts here. I can organize and put it on trello later.

[6:36]  
@kingzlo i agree. we need to break it down to actionable steps.

[6:38]  
So I think in general we have 2-3 options:
1. build front end or back end first, then build the other.
2. build both ends at the same time.
which do you prefer?








kingzlo [6:38 PM] 
I kind of see both

[6:39]  
For the coding we have to figure it out visually in that sense anyway

[6:39]  
example above with figuring out the Simon Game.






sdq [6:40 PM] 
I think we should start with the messaging scheduler and then build up on the meeting assistant. I think trello is great because we can be all organized there and I can easily see everyone's points without sorting through the information




franc [6:40 PM] 
if we do both at the same time, maybe we can have one persona mainly handle the front-end, one person mainly handle the back-end, and another person helping both sides. what do you think?




franc [7:00 PM] 
also, a note regarding the stack:
there's a list on trello called "Slack API and Tools". it has some libraries/tools we may use to build the bot. Please take a look and see which one you would prefer to use.





franc [7:35 PM] 
There's a "Todo" list in the "Planner" board on trello. feel free to add your thoughts in the comment section between now and our next meeting. :slightly_smiling_face:







franc
I was thinking how we can collaborate on making a single page. So I drafted a simple layout in balsamiq.  Maybe we can divide the page into sections and each person takes on a single section. In the end we merge the branches into the master. in github. After we decide the features and details of the bot, we can fill in the content into page. what do you think?










franc [6:40 PM] 
I made a simple user story like this
1. user types / commands
2. message window shows a list of available commands
3. selects a command
4. types date and time
3. drafts the message.
4. hit enter
5. the bot responses with a confirmation message.
6. the message will be automatically sent at the time the user specified.
7. user receives a sent notification.





franc [6:44 PM] 
i think one question for us at the moment is to
1. do the front-end (splash page) first
2. do the back-end (building the bot) first
or
3. do front-end and back-end at the same time
? (edited)

[6:45]  
the stack is mainly a thing for back-end i think





sdq [3:00 PM] 
@franc  I like the story. I was also thinking adding a like a /command e.g /spartanassist_time or a short variation of the that and a scrollable times will pop up and user selects the time







@franc 
- trello bot from slack?
- gitflow. seems a good workflow for collaboration. 
- we need to at lease have 2 branches. one that is always working, the master, another for development
- github can host static sites just fine, but not for something like a online store or heavy backend stuff. we can host the splash page on github for sure. If we are also going to build the bot. I think it will probably be deployed on heroku.
